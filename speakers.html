						<h3>Aaron Irizarry</h3>
						<h5>DESIGNING A CULTURE OF DESIGN</h5>
						<p>Workplace culture doesn’t start with beanbags, foosball tables, or a beer fridge, <br>
						and it doesn’t end with neckties, PCs, or big corporations. It’s the unwritten rules,<br>
						behavior, beliefs, and the motivations that enable good work to get done, or it’s <br>
						what stifles a workforce. For design to be most effective and for designers to feel <br>
						valued, we need to work in a culture that embraces design and allows it to <br>succeed.</p>
						
						<p>In Aaron’s session he will explore how to recognize the traits of organizations that <br>
						*get* design, both large and small. He will share what those teams, departments, <br>
						and companies have that others don’t, and more importantly, how to begin to <br>
						change your own workplace’s culture. Once you’ve worked within a culture of<br>
						design it’s almost impossible to imagine yourself anywhere else.</p>
						
						
						<h5>ABOUT AARON</h5>
						<p>Aaron Irizarry is a Senior Product Designer for Nasdaq OMX, a lover of heavy <br>
						metal, a foodie, and a master of BBQ arts. You can find some of his thoughts and <br>
						presentations on the conversation surrounding design over at <br>
						discussingdesign.com.</p>

						<h3>Adam Connor</h3>
						<h5>LIGHTS! CAMERA! INTERACTION! DESIGN INSPIRATION FROM FILMMAKERS</h5>
						<p>Films succeed in evoking responses and engaging audiences only with a <br>
						combination of well-written narrative and effective storytelling technique. It’s the <br>
						filmmaker’s job to put this together. To do so they’ve developed processes, tools <br>
						and techniques that allow them to focus attention, emphasize information, <br>
						foreshadow and produce the many elements that together comprise a well-told<br> story.</p>
						
						<p>With this workshop, we’ll revisit the topic of using stories in design and expand on <br>
						the technical aspects used in film to communicate. We’ll look at some tools used in <br>
						film, such as cinematic patterns, beat sheets, and storyboards. We’ll consider why <br>
						they’re used and how we might look to them for inspiration.</p>
						
						
						<h5>ABOUT ADAM</h5>
						
						<p>Adam Connor is a designer, illustrator and speaker passionate about collaboration, <br>
						communication, creativity and storytelling. As an Experience Design Director with <br>
						Mad*Pow, Adam combines 10+ years of experience in interaction and experience <br>
						design with a background in computer science, film, and animation to create <br>
						effective and easy-to-use digital products and services. He believes that no matter<br>
						how utilitarian a tool is, at the core of its creation lies a story; uncovering that story <br>
						is key to its success. Occasionally, he shares his perspectives on design at<br>
						adamconnor.com and discussingdesign.com.</p>

						and quickly and how to remove buggy code through testing.</p>

						<h3>Bermon Painter</h3>
						<h5>DEATH TO WIREFRAMES: LONG LIVE RAPID PROTOTYPING</h5>
						<p>Static wireframes are a drag on the whole design process. Prototyping makes <br>
						things a little better by allowing you to stitch together static wireframes or mockups <br>
						while adding basic interactions. Rapid prototyping with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript <br>
						is even better and faster; it increases collaboration and improves the iteration <br>
					process. Kill your wireframes. Long live rapid prototyping.</p>
						
						<h5>ABOUT BERMON</h5>
						<p>Bermon is the organizer of various community groups for user experience<br>
						designers and front-end developers, and the organizer of Blend Conference, a <br>
						three-day, multi-track event for user experience strategists, designers and <br>
						developers. He also leads the user experience team for Cardinal Solutions’<br> 
						Charlotte office, where he consults with large enterprise clients on interesting <br>
						problems across user experience, design and front-end development.</p>
